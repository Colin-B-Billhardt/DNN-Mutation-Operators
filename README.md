# DNN-Mutation-Operators
Research novel mutation operators that can be used to build new mutation testing tools for deep learning systems.

MNISTDecisionTree is novel code that is based of the following research papers [Property Inference for Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13215) and [NNrepair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12535)

MNISTModel file follows a tutorial presented on Kaggle. [kaggle-MNIST-tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/code/prashant111/mnist-deep-neural-network-with-keras#MNIST---Deep-Neural-Network-with-Keras)
